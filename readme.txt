Display WordPress.org contributor profiles on your site using a block or shortcode.

== Description ==

Contributor Highlights is a lightweight plugin designed for individuals and organizations who want to display their WordPress.org contribution journey or highlight the efforts of others in the WordPress community.

With this plugin, you can easily fetch and present detailed contributor information from public WordPress.org profiles. The plugin pulls in and displays:

- Contributor name and avatar
- Contribution weekly pledge
- Short biography
- Contribution badges (e.g., Core Contributor, Plugin Developer, Translation Editor, etc.)
- Meta information such as member since date, location, website, GitHub, employer, and job title

Perfect for personal portfolios, agency team pages, or contributor showcases on community sites.

This plugin does not require any API keys or manual data entry â€” just input a WordPress.org username, and the profile will be automatically rendered in a card format.

Whether you're celebrating your own WordPress journey or recognizing others, Contributor Highlights makes it easy to bring open-source contributions front and center.
